# OOPS-Project

Program chooses the number to be guessed by selecting an integer at random in the range of one
to 1000. The program that displays the following:
I have a number between 1 to 1000. Can you guess my number?
Please type your first guess.
The player then types the first guess the program responds with one of the following
1. Excellent you guessed the number would you like to play again (Y/N)
2. Too low try again
3. Too high try again
If the player&#39;s guess is incorrect, your program should loop until the player finally gets the number right.
Your program should keep telling the player too high or too low to help the player guess the correct
answer.

<h1>Modification 1:</h1>
Modify the program to count the number of guesses the player makes.
 If the number is 10 or fewer, print “Either you know the secret or you got lucky”.
 If it took a player guesses the number in 10 then print “haha you know the secret”.
 If the player makes more than 10 guesses then print “you should be able to do better why
should it take no more than 10 guesses”

Well with each good guess the player should be able to eliminate half the numbers now show why any
number from 1 to 1000 can be guessed in 10 steps.
